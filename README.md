The Frame Android SDK simplifies the process of creating a seamless payment experience within your Android app. It offers versatile, pre-designed UI components that enable you to effortlessly gather payment details from your users. Additionally, it provides access to the underlying APIs that drive these components, allowing you to design fully customized payment workflows tailored to your app's needs.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Minimum Android Version**: 26 (Android 8.0, Oreo)  
- **Kotlin**: 2.2+  
- A valid **Frame API key** from your [Frame Payments Dashboard](https://framepayments.com)


## ✨ Features

- **Reusable UI Components** We have built two ready-to-use UI components for your payment to make it easy to allow customers to check out with your products and enter their payment details with encryption.

- **Pre Packaged API Calls** This SDK has built in support for all available Frame API calls. Each API endpoint has it's own initialization-less class that you can call directly within your code and supports either async/await or completion handlers. See our API Documentation here.

- **Payment Card Encryption** Frame supports payment card encryption using Evervault. It's integrated directly into our CREATE payment method API call to ensure all data transmitted is encrypted before hitting our servers.

## 🚀 Getting Started


1. **Add dependency** in your `build.gradle` (app-level):

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "com.framepayments:framesdk:<latest-version>"
    implementation "com.framepayments:framesdk_ui:<latest-version>"
}
```

2. **Initialize Frame** in your `Application` class:

```kotlin
import com.framepayments.framesdk.FrameNetworking

class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        FrameNetworking.initializeWithAPIKey(context = this, key="your_api_key_here")
    }
}
```

## 📖 Examples

### 1. Load Customer Payment Methods
```kotlin
viewModel.loadCustomerPaymentMethods(
    customerId = "cus_12345",
    amount = 1000
)
```

### 2. Present Checkout View
```kotlin
val checkoutView = FrameCheckoutView(context)
checkoutView.amount = 1000
checkoutView.customerId = "cus_12345"
```

### 3. Refund a Charge
```kotlin
val (refund, error) = RefundsAPI.createRefund(request: { 
    chargeId = "ch_67890",
    amount = 500
  }
)
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- Frame **never stores raw card details** on-device or in your app.  
- All sensitive data is encrypted using [Evervault](https://evervault.com) before transmission.  
- The SDK is PCI-DSS compliant by design.  
- You are responsible for handling customer authentication and complying with local regulations (e.g., SCA, PSD2).
